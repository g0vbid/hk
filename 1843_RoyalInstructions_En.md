Now We do hereby require and enjoin you to call upon the Judge presiding at the trial of any such offenders, to make to you, a written report of the cases of all persons who may from time to time be condemned to suffer death by any sentence of any Court within the said Colony and such reports of the said Judge shall by you be taken into consideration at the first meeting thereafter which may be conveniently held of Our said Executive Council, where the said Judge shall be specially summoned to attend, and you shall not pardon or reprieve any such offenders as aforesaid, unless it shall appear to you expedient so to do upon receiving the advice of Our Executive Council therein, but in all such cases, you are to decide either to extend or withhold a pardon or reprieve according to your own deliberate judgement, whether the Members of Our said Executive Council concur therein or otherwise, entering, nevertheless, on the Minutes of the said Council a Minute of your reasons at length, in case you should decide any such question in opposition to the judgement of the majority of the Members thereof.

36. And whereas you will receive through one of Our principal Secretaries of State, a book of Tables in blank (commonly called the Blue Book,) to be annually filled up with certain returns, relative to the revenue and expenditure, militia, public works, legislation, civil establishments, pensions, population, schools, course of exchange, imports and exports, agricultural produce, manufactures, and other matters in the said Blue Book more particularly specified with reference to the state and condition of Our said Colony. Now We do hereby signify Our pleasure that all such returns be accurately prepared, and punctually transmitted to Us from year to year, through one of Our principal Secretaries of State, and that no Officer in Our said Colony, within whose department it may be to contribute any return or returns for the purposes aforesaid, or to prepare the same when so contributed, shall be entitled to receive, or shall receive from you, any warrant for the payment of his official salary, which may become due and payable to him so long as such duty as aforesaid shall be in arrear, or remain unperformed.

37. And We do hereby declare Our pleasure to be, that the preceding Instructions shall be taken and understood as addressed to the Governor for the time being of Our said Colony, or to the officer for the time being administering the Government thereof, notwithstanding the same or any part thereof, may be in terms addressed to you, the said Sir Henry Pottinger.

38. And We do hereby reserve to Ourselves, Our Heirs and Successors, full power and authority from time to time, to revoke, alter, renew, or explain, these Our Instructions or any part thereof.
